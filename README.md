# Task description:

For the completion of this task, I used Visual Studio Code as the development environment. The goal was to create an E-learning Platform where users can explore courses, enroll in them, and track their learning progress. This project makes use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and focuses on concepts like event handling and localStorage. This platform is name learnity which means (learn+infinity) infinite learning
The platform begins with a visually appealing homepage that contains a navigation bar linking to other sections like Home, Courses, About, and My Courses. The header is styled to be responsive and remains fixed at the top for better navigation. A small video is also embedded to make it responsive and visually appealing to the user. Thereafter, a small section showsasing an upcoming course is shown with a register now button.

The main section, titled "Explore Our Courses", displays a variety of course cards such as Web Development, Python Programming, Java, UI/UX, Cybersecurity, AI, Data Science, and many more.
Each course card contains an image, a heading, a short description, and a “Start Learning” button. When the user clicks this button, the course is added to their personal list using the enrollCourse() function in JavaScript. Automatically adding the particular course to the My Courses page. This function stores the course in a list maintained using localStorage, ensuring the data persists even if the page is refreshed or reopened later. The index.html page also has an about us section followed by a footer for a perfect completion.

The enrolled courses are displayed on a separate page called "My Courses", which dynamically loads the user’s selected courses using the loadCourse() function. For each enrolled course, a progress bar is shown along with a button to increment progress. When the user clicks the progress button, the course's progress increases by 10%, and once it reaches 100%, a “Completed” message is shown. All progress data is stored in localStorage for long-term use.

A key feature of the project is data persistence using browser storage. Both the enrolled course list and individual progress are stored locally, simulating a basic backend-free learning management system.

From a design perspective, all UI elements are styled using CSS. The course cards are displayed using a flexible grid layout, and each component has been styled for clarity and visual appeal. Shadows, hover effects, rounded corners, and consistent spacing make the interface clean and user-friendly. Special care was taken to fix alignment issues and layout bugs by ensuring that all HTML elements are properly closed and structured.

Application:

Overall, this task simulates a mini learning dashboard and can be expanded with features like quiz modules, video embeds, or authentication in the future. It reflects real-world web development concepts and provides a strong foundation for building larger, more complex front-end applications. It can be very useful for students all over the world to access the courses and keep learning, which is why Whoever,Whenever and Wherever is emphasised.
